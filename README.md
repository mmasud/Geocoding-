Python’s geocoding — Convert a list of addresses into a map

How to work with Googles geocoding APIs to transform a list of address (postal address) into geospatial data — latitudes and longitudes so that we can present them on compelling maps.

For this task, I used Python’s geopy library to get locations (and more).

Finally, display the collected data on a map with folium and plotly and save the map into .html file.
